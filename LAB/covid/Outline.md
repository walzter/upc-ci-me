## Abstract

## Introduction --> Can be extended in the Appendices. 
- What is the problem?
    - SARS-CoV-2, novel coronavirus, and how it has affected us etc.. 
    - Testing methods exist which are accuracte, precise and cost-effective 
        - Rapid Antigen Testing (reagent)
    - Other to be more accurate need more specified equipment such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) machines, which are costly, and take time to process each of the samples. 
    - During the beginning of the pandemic, multiple univiersiteis have implemented a method to be able to predict whether a person has SARS-CoV-2, by taking a sample of their cough. This was done using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and, using as inputs the converted the audio file (in this case .WAV) into a Mel-Spectrogram. 
    - Mel-Spectrogram measures the intensity of the frequency by applying a lograithmic scale on the audio values, it is derived from melody. 
    - it can give us a linear relationship between the sounds, and make it more recognizable for us, as humans to distinguish this. However, there can be distortions which are small and we could not recognize even though they are in our hearing frequency. 
## Literarture Review
- Mention the previous works done with this dataset and their results
